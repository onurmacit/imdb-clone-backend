![localhost](./images/imdb_clone.png)

## Project Status: Actively Developing üöß

This project is currently under active development, focusing on building a robust movie database platform with Django. The backend is designed with best practices and modern architecture, while the frontend utilizes Django templates with dynamic JavaScript enhancements.

### Current Development Focus:
- Enhancing the movie rating system
- Implementing user reviews and comments
- Adding advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Optimizing server-side rendering performance
- Implementing category-based movie browsing

## Description
This is a modern IMDb clone built with Django and Django Rest Framework, featuring a robust backend API and server-side rendered frontend. The project demonstrates modern web development practices including containerization, CI/CD, and cloud integration, with a focus on performance and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - JWT-based authentication system
  - Custom user model with email-based authentication
  - Role-based access control

- **Movie Management**
  - Comprehensive movie information storage
  - Multiple category support for each movie
  - Advanced rating system with user scores
  - Cloud-based image handling with Cloudinary

- **Frontend Features**
  - Server-side rendering with Django Templates
  - Dynamic content loading with vanilla JavaScript
  - Responsive design with Bootstrap
  - Modern UI with CSS animations

- **Performance & Scaling**
  - Redis caching for improved performance
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - Asynchronous task processing with Celery
  - Containerized with Docker for easy scaling

- **Security & Quality**
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
  - Code quality enforcement with linting
  - Secure media handling with Cloudinary

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.9
- Django 4.2
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Celery
- JWT Authentication

### Frontend
- Django Templates
- Bootstrap 5
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS3 with modern features

### Storage & Caching
- Cloudinary (Media Storage)
- Redis (Caching & Message Broker)

### DevOps & Tools
- Docker & Docker Compose

- Pytest for testing

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/imdb-clone.git
cd imdb-clone
```
### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure to have Python 3.9+ and Docker installed. Then install the project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Create a .env file
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```
### 4. Build and run the Docker containers
Build and run the Docker containers. This command will set up the Django application, PostgreSQL database, and Redis server.
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
### 5. Run the migrations
Once the containers are up, run the migrations:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```
### 6. Access the application
The application will be available at http://localhost:8000/.

### 7. Create a superuser (optional)
To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```
## CI/CD Process

**Continuous Integration (CI)** ensures that every code change is automatically tested and linted, maintaining code quality and preventing bugs. **Continuous Deployment (CD)** will be implemented in the future to automate the deployment process.

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to manage continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes. Code quality is checked with **Flake8**, **Black**, and **isort** on every pull request. Tests are run integrated with PostgreSQL on every code update.

The CI process includes the following steps:
- Running tests.
- Linting and code quality checks.
- Testing database configurations.

For detailed CI/CD configuration, you can refer to the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/lint.yml` files.


## Deployment

Currently, there is no deployment pipeline. This project is focused on the development and testing phase, with Dockerized local development and CI integration through GitHub Actions.

## Latest Changes
The most recent update to the project includes integrating Cloudinary for handling media storage. Now, images can be uploaded and stored securely in Cloudinary, instead of being saved locally.
